# README

### Welcome to findmy, my final project for App Academy.

Yelp is ugly and junked up with features. This app aims to be neither of those things, while still allowing you to search for businesses, rate businesses, and 'favorite' the ones you like best.

Enjoy!

#### Details, details...

I'm running Ruby Version 2.0.0, Rails Version 4.0.2

This app utilizes these APIs:

[Yelp v2](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation)

[Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/web/) 

[Google Geocoding](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/)

#### Upcoming Features (in order of ambition)

* Incorporate FourSquare and Google Places.

* Businesses should have hours of operation. (Need more than just Yelp's API.)

* Improvements to the recommendation algorithm. Perhaps recommend based on other users?
