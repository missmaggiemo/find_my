# TODO


Upcoming features:

* Let users dismiss recommendations. (Mark as viewed, go away.)

* Tile images in feed with text on top- If you have images, make them as big as is manageable.

* Businesses should have hours of operation. Probably need to scrape Yelp for that.

* Change layout of business to include user's rating if they've rated that business.

* Business pages incorporate FourSquare and Google Places.

* Users can recommend businesses to their friends- create an instance of the recommendation model? Let users include a note as to why they're recommending the biz?

* Recommendations based on similar users. (Kth neartest neighbor based on ratings and favorites?)
