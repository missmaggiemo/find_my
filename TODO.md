# TODO

Something like "map loading" instead of blank page while the map is loading-- 
even a nice background image would be fine. 
But the blank page is extremely disconcerting.

### Searches

Autofill current location

Fancy links for searches?

### Businesses

Fancy links for businesses?


### Locations

From your location, should be able to see highest rated restaurants? 

Highest rated stuff comes up on root new search page? (Pins in the highest-rated stuff on the map?)

### Neighborhoods

Should be able to visit the page for your neighborhood and see the highest rated restaurants, etc.

### Users


Add users.

* Users have ratings which are different from the Yelp ratings -> ratings model?

Add Facebook login for users?

Users can save searches-- keep track of frequent searches?


### Ratings

Users have ratings, restuarants have ratings, 

user_id | business_id | rating_number (int or float?)

### Production

SET HEROKU PRODUCTION VARS BEFORE PUSHING TO PRODUCTION
