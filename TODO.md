# TODO

Something like "map loading" instead of blank page while the map is loading-- even a nice background image would be fine. But the blank page is extremely disconcerting.

### Searches

Pins for businesses.

Fancy links for searches?

**searches aren't objects-- just calls a get method, etc. Users can save searches by saving the links to the searches.

### Businesses

Fancy links for businesses?

/business/name-of-business-city-state

Highest rated stuff comes up on root new search page? (Pins in the highest-rated stuff on the map?)

### Neighborhoods

Should be able to visit the page for your neighborhood and see the highest rated restaurants, etc.

### Users


Add users.

* Users have ratings which are different from the Yelp ratings -> ratings model?

Add Facebook login for users?

### Ratings

Users have ratings, restuarants have ratings, 

user_id | business_id | rating_number (int or float?)

#### Reviews?
